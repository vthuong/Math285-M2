# Project for Advanced Topics in Mathematics, Fall 2018
## Overview
This project was inspired by the Wildfire breakout that happened in California and the Haze crisis that happened annually in
Southeast Asia (the worst haze crisis was in 2015).

It simulates the fire speading in an area represented by a grid of trees and empty spots.
